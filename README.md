# What

https://github.com/peppercornstudio/pollen but in SCSS / SASS / Stylus / LESS

# Why

Nice to have some default vars in SCSS / SASS / Stylus / LESS instead of coming up with new ones for every project.

Also, SCSS / Stylus vars feel much cleaner to me and have 100% browser support unlike CSS vars which need a polyfill.
